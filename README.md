TODO
====

## Urgent
- include update URL
  - Not necessary when using the chrome developers dashboard
  - Only to be used when self hosting the packaged version
- figure out how to compile to actual webapp
  - The "package" buttons works again in chrome
- publish in chrome webstore
  - Awaits approval
  - chrome dashboard at: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard

## Not so urgent
- add in delays
- auto add station based on html5 geolocation
- use appcache to remember window position on exit
- cache frequent request
